    "## Introduction\n",
    "**Capillary Electrophoresis (CE) - Mass Spectrometry (MS)** is a multi-dimensional analytical separation instrument used for analysis of biological samples among others. Upon injection, a current is applied and compounds within samples are separated as they migrate through the capillary by their respective electrophoretic mobility differences before reaching a time-of-flight (TOF) mass detector. In spite of CE-MS being a highly accurate and robust detection method, ambient and human variables can cause the same compound to migrate at different times despite otherwise identical conditions. This variability has no impact on the detection and quantification of compounds. However, dependable known migration times through a predictive model empowers replacement of expensive chemical standards through higher confidence of compound identification by additional evidence to accurate mass and isotopic pattern information and thus increases the value of datasets containing unknowns. With multiple experimental runs, there may be multiple instances of a compound and recorded migration times. This dynamic experimental data is annotated with relevant physicochemical properties and miscellaneous metadata to provide context to produced machine learning results. For respective compounds, chemical databases can be used to extract properties to perform calculations for relevant features such as effective mobility, molecular volume, and absolute compound mobility. Following training and profiling of model performance, further annotation to chemical compound classes can give context to results stemming from the model.\n",
